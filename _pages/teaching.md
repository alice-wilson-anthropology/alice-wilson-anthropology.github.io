My teaching covers undergraduate and graduate students across fields including: political anthropology, economic anthropology, social theory and the anthropology of the Southwest Asia and North Africa.

I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

Current and recent teaching: 

- "Thinking like an Anthropologist" (MA core module)
- "Reconciliation and Reconstruction" (MA optional module)
- "Slavery, Emancipation, Legacies" (final year undergraduate optional module)
- "Cultures of North Africa, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia" (second year undergraduate elective)
- "Practising Anthropology" (first year undergraduate core module)

I am interested in supervising doctoral projects addressing revolution, radical social change, refugees and asymlum seekers, postconflict transitions, and militarization and its legacies.
